# Livestream Functionality - Issues Fixed and Verified

## Task Completed Successfully âœ…

The livestream functionality has been fully fixed and tested live on the webpage.

## Issues Identified and Resolved:

### 1. Infinite Re-render Loop âœ… FIXED

- **Problem**: Functions in `StreamingContext.tsx` were causing "Maximum update depth exceeded" errors
- **Solution**: Wrapped `joinStream` and `leaveStream` functions in `useCallback` hooks
- **Files Modified**: `src/contexts/StreamingContext.tsx`

### 2. Anonymous Viewer Connection Blocked âœ… FIXED

- **Problem**: `LiveViewer.tsx` required user authentication to join streams
- **Solution**: Removed authentication requirement while keeping authenticated features protected
- **Files Modified**: `src/pages/LiveViewer.tsx`

### 3. Token-Free Agora Configuration âœ… VERIFIED

- **Status**: Confirmed working properly for open access without tokenization
