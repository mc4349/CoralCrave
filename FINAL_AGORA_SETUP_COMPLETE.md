## 🔒 **Security Recommendations**

Your Agora project currently shows "Project is not secured! Disable Unauthorised Access". For production deployment:

### **Option 1: Keep Unsecured (Easiest for Development)**

- ✅ Current setup works immediately
- ✅ No token server required
- ⚠️ Less secure for production

### **Option 2: Enable Security (Recommended for Production)**

1. **Enable App Certificate** in Agora Console
2. **Implement token server** (we have the certificate ready)
3. **Update token generation** in your backend
4. **More secure** but requires additional setup
