### Development Notes

**NPM Configuration for D: Drive:**
The project is configured to use the D: drive for npm cache and global packages to avoid disk space issues on the C: drive:

```bash
npm config set cache "D:/npm-cache"
npm config set prefix "D:/npm-global"
```

**Mock Type Definitions:**
The project includes mock type definitions in `src/types/` to resolve TypeScript errors during development:

- `react.d.ts` - Mock React and React Router types
- `vite.d.ts` - Mock Vite build tool types
- `css.d.ts` - CSS module declarations

These are automatically overridden when actual packages are installed.
