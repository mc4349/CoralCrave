## üß™ READY TO TEST?

If the above 4 items are verified, you can test stream creation:

### Test Steps:

1. **Go to your website**: http://localhost:5173 (or your dev server URL)
2. **Sign in**: Use Google or email/password
3. **Try to start a stream**: Go to "Go Live" or stream creation
4. **Check browser console**: Look for success messages instead of 400 errors

### Expected Success Messages:

```
üöÄ Creating livestream with FAST execution...
‚ö° FAST: Livestream created in Firestore: [stream-id]
‚úÖ Stream created successfully
```

### If Still Getting 400 Errors:

- **Wait 10-15 minutes**: APIs need time to propagate
- **Check billing plan**: Must be Blaze, not Spark
- **Verify security rules**: Must allow authenticated writes
- **Clear browser cache**: Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)

## üö® IGNORE REDIS ERRORS

The Redis connection errors in your server terminal are **NORMAL** and **SAFE TO IGNORE**:

- Redis is optional for development
- Your server will work without Redis
- Streams will still save to Firestore
- Only affects advanced auction features

**Focus on Firestore - that's what needs to work for streams!**
