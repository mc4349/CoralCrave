   VITE_AGORA_APP_ID=a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0k1l2m3n4o5p6
   ```
4. Save the file

### Step 5: Restart Development Server

## Troubleshooting

### Google Sign-In Issues:
- **"Popup blocked"**: Allow popups for localhost in browser settings
- **"Unauthorized domain"**: Add `localhost` to authorized domains in Firebase
- **"OAuth error"**: Check that Google provider is enabled in Firebase Console

### Agora Livestreaming Issues:
- **"Camera not found"**: Check browser permissions for camera/microphone
- **"Failed to join channel"**: Verify App ID is correct in `.env.local`
- **"Network error"**: Check internet connection and firewall settings
- **"Invalid App ID"**: Double-check the App ID from Agora Console

### General Issues:
- **Environment variables not loading**: Restart the development server after changing `.env.local`
- **CORS errors**: Make sure you're accessing via `http://localhost:5173` not `127.0.0.1`

## Next Steps (Optional)

### For Production Deployment:
1. **Agora Token Server**: Set up secure token generation for production
2. **Domain Configuration**: Add your production domain to Firebase authorized domains
3. **SSL Certificate**: Ensure HTTPS for camera/microphone access in production
4. **Agora App Certificate**: Enable for enhanced security

### For Enhanced Features:
1. **Stripe Integration**: For payment processing
2. **Push Notifications**: For bid alerts and stream notifications
